            Hey there! I'm Asir Adnan, currently sailing through the exciting seas of computer science at BRAC University, where I'm in my third year of pursuing a BS in Computer Science. <br/><br/>
            I love <a href="cp.html">Competitive Programming</a> which makes it easy for me to apply my "liking to think" attribute and my coding skills altogether. <br/><br/>
            Also, I teach myself development tools to treat myself with delicious <a href="projects.html">Projects</a>!
